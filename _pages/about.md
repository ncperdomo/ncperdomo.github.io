I am a PhD candidate at Indiana University working on active tectonics and crustal deformation modeling. My work integrates geodetic data with analytical and numerical models to study how deformation is partitioned between faults and the surrounding crust throughout the earthquake cycle, and how transient viscoelastic mantle flow influences surface strain rates.

#### Research interests

- Earthquake-cycle deformation
  - How transient is the deformation observed between earthquakes? 
  - What role do mantle processes play in driving present-day surface deformation?
  - How much deformation occurs off-fault throughout the earthquake cycle? Is it primarily elastic or inelastic, and what are the implications for seismic hazard? 
  - Is the relative contribution of off-fault deformation lower around mature fault systems than around complex fault zones?
